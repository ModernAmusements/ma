The processing of personal data (Article 4 No. 2 DSGVO) is carried out for the provision of this website and the marketing of the products, in particular for the conclusion and execution of contracts, for billing, for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, for answering inquiries in connection with our business relationship and for all activities necessary with the operation and administration of the company.

2In the context of balancing interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DSGVO) In addition, we process your data beyond the provision of the website and the actual performance of the contract to protect legitimate interests of us or third parties, such as in particular in the following cases:

Instagram:

## Instagram

We have integrated components of the service Instagram on our Internet pages. Instagram is a service that qualifies as an audiovisual platform and allows users to share photos and videos and also to redistribute such data in other social networks. The operating company of the Instagram services is Instagram LLC, 1 Hacker Way, Building 14 First Floor, Menlo Park, CA, USA.


Each time one of the individual pages of this website operated by us is called up and on which an Instagram component (Insta button) has been integrated, the internet browser on the information technology system of the data subject is automatically caused by the respective Instagram component to download a representation of the corresponding component from Instagram. Within the scope of this technical procedure, Instagram receives knowledge about which specific subpage of our website is visited by the data subject.


If the data subject is logged in to Instagram at the same time, Instagram recognizes which specific sub-page the data subject is visiting each time the data subject calls up our website and for the entire duration of the respective stay on our website. This information is collected by the Instagram component and assigned by Instagram to the respective Instagram account of the data subject. If the data subject activates one of the Instagram buttons integrated on our website, the data and information thus transmitted will be assigned to the personal Instagram user account of the data subject and stored and processed by Instagram.


Instagram always receives information via the Instagram component that the data subject has visited our website if the data subject is simultaneously logged into Instagram at the time of calling up our website; this takes place regardless of whether the data subject clicks on the Instagram component or not. If the data subject does not want this information to be transmitted to Instagram, he or she can prevent the transmission by logging out of his or her Instagram account before accessing our website.
