# First There Was Nothing
****

This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair. You're **George McFly**. Yeah, well history is gonna change. No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has got to be done about your kids.

Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Doc, she didn't even look at him. Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you? No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00 you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George. he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.

Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Marty, why are you so nervous? Ronald Reagon. Well, I guess that's everything.

# Earease and Rewind
****

It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man **Peabody**, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. Wait a minute. What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Yeah.

Right. He's a peeping tom. *Dad. Next, please. Great Scott*. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?

Who? You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you. You broke it. Wow, look at him go. Okay. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll.
