Description:

Threw one of the opening parties for imm trade fair 2018 at Museum für Angewandte Kunst Köln (MAKK). They showcased and awarded their selection of best novelties in the field of product design. Teaming up with design duo.

We were commissioned to design the event’s identity—a key visual, invitations, exhibition graphics, exhibition catalogue and merchandise. Referring to projections as the main idea of the exhibition design, holographic award badges built the central graphic design element, in combination with clean typography.
